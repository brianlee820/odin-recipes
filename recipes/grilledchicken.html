<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Healthy and easy-to-make food perfect for post-workout session</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped shallot</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>8 cups baby arugula</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Whisk ¼ cup olive oil, balsamic vinegar, shallot, Dijon mustard, and ½ teaspoon salt together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed.</li>
    <li>Brush 1 teaspoon oil onto cut-side of peaches.</li>
    <li>Place peaches, cut-side down, onto grill and cook until heated through, about 4 minutes. Transfer peaches to a plate.</li>
    <li>Brush remaining oil onto both sides of chicken breasts and season with salt.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on grill until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Slice chicken into thin pieces and cut peaches into ½-inch thick pieces.</li>
